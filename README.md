Gamejam Boilerplate for Love
================

Boilerplate code from various sources for [love](http://www.love2d.org) with gamestate, gui and menus for game jams like [ludum dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/). **Heavily** inspired (actually partly copied) by [Headchant's](http://www.headchant.com) [love-boilerplate](https://github.com/headchant/love-boilerplate) and as he says: Credits and thanks go to [VRLD](https://github.com/vrld/) and Kikito!

Uses the following:
* [hump](https://github.com/vrld/hump) for vectors, gamestates etc. pp.
* [SLAM](https://github.com/vrld/Stuff/tree/master/slam) for better sound control
* [tween.lua](https://github.com/kikito/tween.lua)
* [strict.lua](http://metalua.luaforge.net/src/lib/strict.lua.html)

Includes the following for fast use:
* [Quickie](https://github.com/vrld/Quickie) for buttons and menus
* [HardonCollider](http://vrld.github.com/HardonCollider/) for collision detection

Stuff I added:
* Resource loading on start-up for images, sounds and shaders.
* Working (but maybe suboptimal) HSV/RGB shader functions (I like rainbows)
